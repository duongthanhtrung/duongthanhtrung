# 99Tech Code Challenge

This repository contains my solutions for the 99Tech Code Challenge as part of the interview process.

## About Me ##
- **Position Applied:** Front-End Developer
- **Problems Attempted:**
    - **Problem 1:** Sum the integers from 1 to `n` using three different methods in JavaScript.
    - **Problem 2:** [Description or Goal of Problem 2]
    - **Problem 3:** [Description or Goal of Problem 3]

I have focused on demonstrating my skills in front-end development by tackling the above problems. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.

## Assumptions and Input Validation ##
For Problem 1, I have added validation to ensure the input is a positive integer greater than 0. This is to handle potential edge cases where a non-positive integer could cause issues in the summation process. Although the problem specifies that the input will always produce a result lesser than `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`, Iâ€™ve included this validation to safeguard against unexpected inputs and ensure correct functionality in a broader context.
